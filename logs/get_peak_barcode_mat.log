Prepare peak by barcode matrix ...
It looks like the read file is in sam format.
I am reading region information file: output/peaks/ss_peaks.narrowPeak .
I have successfully read 504 regions from output/peaks/ss_peaks.narrowPeak 
...
Now I am starting to process reads file: output/raw_matrix/tmp.sam .
...
I have read 470191 reads from input read file: output/raw_matrix/tmp.sam .
I have read 9737 reads are overlapped .
Now I am writing the output to output/raw_matrix/ss.peak.barcode.mat .
Output matrix is in the file output/raw_matrix/ss.peak.barcode.mat  . 
Output barcodes are in the file output/raw_matrix/ss.barcodes  . 
Get Matrix Done!
