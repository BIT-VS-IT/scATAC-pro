Doing QC per barcode ...
It looks like the read file is in sam format.
Now I am starting to process reads file: ../tmp_output/qc_result/tmp.sam .
...
I have read 500004 reads from input read file: ../tmp_output/qc_result/tmp.sam .
And 17517 reads from input reads are overlapped in given region.
Now I am writing the output to ../tmp_output/qc_result/ss.bwa.freq.mito .
Output is in the file ../tmp_output/qc_result/ss.bwa.freq.mito  . 
It looks like the read file is in sam format.
I am reading cluster information file: ../tmp_output/peaks/ss_peaks.narrowPeak .
I have successfully read 504 regions from ../tmp_output/peaks/ss_peaks.narrowPeak
